    <p>This node is a type unknown to your installation of Node-RED.</p>
    <p><i>If you deploy with the node in this state, it's configuration will be preserved, but

    <p>It is possible this node type is already installed, but is missing a dependency. Check the Node-RED start-up log for
       any error messages associated with the missing node type. Use <b>npm install &lt;module&gt;</b> to install any missing modules
       and restart Node-RED and reimport the nodes.</p>
    <p>Otherwise, you should contact the author of the flow to obtain a copy of the missing node type.</p>
